# D2L Plus

## What is D2L?
D2L (Desire to Learn) is a web platform managed by educatonal institutions (University of Arizona, in our case) to connect students and instructors, get announcements of courses, get and submit assignments and more.

## What this project is about
This repository contains the code of the Flutter app that is supposed to bring D2L to mobile devices and make it easier to access on the go. Moreover, this app would bring the following features into D2L:
 - Enroll into courses from the app
 - View and rate the class and the instructor of that class
 - Simplified calendar to view classes schedule and deadlines.
 - Push notifications about upcoming deadline, grades posted or any other course changes
 - AI chatbot that can answer any question regarding the studies of the individual student (it has the access to all info about this student)

## We won?
Yes, the project is won the 2nd place in the hackathon in the nomination of AWS Tech Stack runner app.

## Why AWS Tech Stack?
Because our backend heavily uses and relies on bunch of AWS services. Here is the list of some services:
 - Lambda
 - S3
 - Bedrock (for AI chatbot)
 - API Gateway
 - IAM
 - ECS
 - SNS (for push notifications)
 - and more...

The backend was developed by [Garegin Mazmanyan](https://github.com/tothelast) and the code is posted [here](https://github.com/tothelast/d2l-plus).
